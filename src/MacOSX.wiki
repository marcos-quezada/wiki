  1. Install and configure vim, with all required plugins.
  2. Create the following AppleScript on Automator > Services

{{{
on run {input}
	set cmd to "vim -f -g --servername Notes -u ~/.vim/notes.vim"
	tell application "System Events" to set terminalIsRunning to exists application process "iTerm"
	tell application "iTerm"
		if terminalIsRunning is false then
			create window with default profile
		end if
		tell current session of current window
			write text cmd
		end tell
	end tell
end run
}}}

Note: -g option in command only if MacVim is installed and is prefered.
