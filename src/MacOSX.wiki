=== vimwiki ===

  1.- Install and configure vim, with all required plugins.
 
  2.- Create the following AppleScript on Automator > Services
{{{
on run {input}
	set cmd to "vim -f -g --servername Notes -u ~/.vim/notes.vim"
	tell application "System Events" to set terminalIsRunning to exists application process "iTerm"
	tell application "iTerm"
		if terminalIsRunning is false then
			create window with default profile
		end if
		tell current session of current window
			write text cmd
		end tell
	end tell
end run
}}}
Note: -g option in command only if MacVim is installed and is prefered.
  
  3.- Assign a shortcut in System Preferences.

===Create bootable USB ===
1.- Format the USB from the *Disk Utility* 
Note: Change format to *Mac OS Extended (Journaled)* and make sure the partition scheme is *GUID Partition Table*

2.- Download image and convert to IMG

`hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/Path-to-IMG-file ~/Path-to-ISO-file`

3.- Identify and unmount the USB drive

`diskutil list`

`diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN`

4.- Create the bootable USB

`sudo dd if=/Path-to-IMG-DMG-file of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m`

Once it's done, if you see the dialogue box _The disk was not readable by this computer_ *IGNORE! And don't interact until...*

`diskutil eject /dev/diskN`

* iTerm
* zsh
* oh-myzsh
